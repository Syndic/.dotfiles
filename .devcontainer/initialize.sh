# devcontainer.json `initializeCommand` — runs ON THE HOST, before the image is
# built and the container created, on every `devcontainer up`. Its job: make the
# repo's git metadata reachable inside the container at THE SAME ABSOLUTE PATH it
# has on the host, for ANY checkout layout (full clone, the main worktree, or a
# linked worktree living anywhere on disk).
#
# Why this exists. When the `devcontainer` CLI opens a git *worktree*, the
# worktree's `.git` is a FILE reading `gitdir: <main-repo>/.git/worktrees/<name>`
# — a host-absolute path outside the workspace. That path isn't mounted, so every
# in-container git command fails. (VS Code's Dev Containers extension special-
# cases this; the CLI does not.)
#
# The constraint that shapes the mechanism: devcontainer.json's `mounts`,
# `runArgs`, and `build.args` are resolved at config-parse time and can only
# interpolate `${localEnv:VAR}` / `${localWorkspaceFolder}` — NOT a value an
# initializeCommand computes (a child process can't set the CLI's env). So the
# freshly-discovered absolute common-dir path can't be named as a mount target
# directly. We bridge it WITHOUT any GIT_* override and WITHOUT a system-wide env
# var by splitting the work between a static bind mount and the image build:
#
#   1. Drop a symlink at a fixed, workspace-relative path
#      (.devcontainer/.host-git-common) pointing at the real common dir. Docker
#      follows the symlink host-side when it binds it, so devcontainer.json can
#      name a STATIC mount source ("${localWorkspaceFolder}/.devcontainer/
#      .host-git-common") that resolves to wherever the main repo actually is,
#      and bind it to a static container path (/host-git-common).
#   2. Persist the absolute common-dir path to
#      .git-plumbing/host-git-common-path. It lands in the build context
#      (context: "..") so the Dockerfile can read it and recreate that exact
#      host-absolute path inside the image as a symlink to /host-git-common.
#      With that in place the worktree's `.git` file resolves natively — git
#      reads its real contents and follows the host-absolute pointer, no
#      GIT_DIR/GIT_COMMON_DIR/GIT_WORK_TREE needed.
#
#      The path file lives inside a tracked .git-plumbing/ dir (anchored by a
#      committed README.md) rather than as a bare gitignored sibling. Reason:
#      buildx errors on a COPY whose source glob matches zero files (the
#      classic .pat[h] optional-COPY trick works on the legacy builder but
#      not buildx), so the Dockerfile COPYs the *directory* — which always
#      exists — and treats the file inside as optional via a shell
#      `[ -s ... ]` test. CI's `devcontainer build` doesn't run
#      initializeCommand, so the path file is genuinely absent there; the
#      tracked README makes the COPY a guaranteed no-op in that case.
#
# Both runtime artifacts (symlink + path file) are gitignored and regenerated
# on every `up`, so nothing the host tracks is touched and the values can
# never go stale. The scheme works for several worktrees concurrently: each
# carries its own symlink/path file and bakes its own host-absolute symlink
# into its own image, binding its own /host-git-common — no cross-container
# collision.
