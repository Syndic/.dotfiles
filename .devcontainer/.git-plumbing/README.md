# Devcontainer host-plumbing artifacts

Holds host-generated artifacts that bridge host state into the devcontainer
image. These files are gitignored and written on every `devcontainer up` by
`../initialize.sh`:

- `host-git-common-path` — absolute path of the host's git common directory
  (`git rev-parse --git-common-dir`). The Dockerfile reads it at build time
  and recreates that same host-absolute path inside the image as a symlink
  to `/host-git-common`, so a worktree's `.git` file resolves natively
  in-container. See the "Worktree git resolution" section in the repo's
  `CLAUDE.md` for the why.
- `host-timezone` — IANA zone name (e.g. `America/Los_Angeles`) of the
  host's timezone. The Dockerfile reads it and symlinks `/etc/localtime`,
  so container timestamps match the host. See "Host timezone plumbing"
  in `CLAUDE.md`.
- `host-gitconfig` — snapshot of the host's `~/.gitconfig`. `post-start.sh`
  installs it into the container only when `~/.gitconfig` is empty (i.e.
  the `devcontainer` CLI path; VS Code's Dev Containers extension copies
  it for itself). See "Signed commits under devcontainer CLI" in
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- `host-known-hosts` — snapshot of the host's `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
  `post-start.sh` installs it under the same missing-or-empty guard as the
  gitconfig, so in-container `git push` over the SSH remote doesn't fail
  "Host key verification failed". See "Signed commits under devcontainer
  CLI" in `CLAUDE.md`.
- `host-allowed-signers` — snapshot of the file named by the host's
  `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile`. `post-start.sh` installs it and repoints
  the config at the copy, so `git verify-commit` trusts our SSH-signed
  commits in-container. See "Signed commits under devcontainer CLI" in
  `CLAUDE.md`.

This directory exists in git (via this README) so the Dockerfile's
`COPY .devcontainer/.git-plumbing/ …` step always finds a source — buildx
errors on a COPY whose glob matches zero files, and CI's `devcontainer
build` doesn't run `initializeCommand`, so the runtime-written files are
absent there. The tracked README makes the COPY a guaranteed no-op in that
case while keeping the runtime artifacts out of the index.
